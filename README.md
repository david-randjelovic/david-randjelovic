# üí´ About Me:
üíº Work history: I am a full stack web developer with over four years of experience in the IT sector. Initially, my career began as a junior front-end developer, where my responsibilities included developing functional front-end features, connecting front and back ends through REST APIs, and implementing third-party APIs like Google Maps and Google Places into our applications. Within around two years, through dedication and the mentorship of a colleague from the backend team, I transitioned into a full stack web development role. Meanwhile I also mastered creating end-to-end Python tests in order to ensure stability of our software solutions.<br><br>üìö My education: I developed an interest in coding during elementary school, learning video game development through YouTube tutorials and creating my first game with Game Maker Studio. I participated in events like the Global Game Jam in Technical High School, where I also took web development classes covering HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This led me to pursue further education at ITAcademy, where I received a web designer certification and improved my skills in JS, HTML, and CSS. After ITAcademy, I secured an internship that transitioned into my first job as an Angular developer.<br><br>‚ùì What am I currently doing on GitHub: For my past and current roles, I've primarily used Bitbucket. However, I'm planning to update my GitHub profile in order to present my journey better. I hope that I'll be able to dedicate some time to developing a few repositories soon.
